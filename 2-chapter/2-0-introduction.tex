In this chapter, we introduce a notable application for the methods we present in Chapters~\ref{ch:exploiting-locality-in-polynomial-approximations} and~\ref{ch:distributed-preconditioning}.
This application is particularly interesting due to the smooth yet nonlinear parameter dependence of PDE coefficients.
We will use this to showcase the methodology in Chapters~\ref{ch:exploiting-locality-in-polynomial-approximations} and~\ref{ch:distributed-preconditioning} in the numerical experiments of Chapters~\ref{ch:locality-in-parameterized-domains} and~\ref{ch:distributed-preconditioning-for-the-parameterized-scatterer}, respectively.

In this example, we will focus on partial differential equations with parameterized domains.
In this chapter, we will introduce this problem in Section~\ref{sec:parameterized-domains} and its treatment using the mapping approach in Section~\ref{sec:mapping-approach}.
The resulting setting fits neatly into the case of a PDE with parameterized coefficients from equations~\eqref{eq:varformpoisson} and~\eqref{eq:varformhelmholtz}.
When mapping to a reference domain, we have to choose an explicit mapping, which we will discuss in Sections~\ref{subsec:mollifier-mapping} and~\ref{subsec:harmonic-mapping}.
